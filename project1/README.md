Get Time Command

Goal: print current time to the user (military time)

Navigate to https://github.com/smith7mx/it3038c-scripts and click the green “Code” button and download the zipped file
Unzip the file (Most likely in the Downloads folder)
Make sure python is downloaded
Use the “cd” command and change file path to C:\Users\[USERNAME]\Downloads\it3038c-scripts-main\it3038c-scripts-main\project1 (My file path had 2 it3038-scripts-main but others might not)
Use the command “python project1.py” to run the script
